# Windsurf Rules for registryaccord-specs

scope:
  - Canonical specifications repo for RegistryAccord: schemas (Lexicon v1), ADRs, governance, and examples.

authoring:
  - Use Lexicon v1 JSON under schemas/lexicons with NSIDs (reverse-DNS), e.g., com.registryaccord.identity.
  - Keep changes backward compatible; breaking changes require new NSIDs per evolution policy.
  - Provide examples for each schema in examples/ and link them from schemas/INDEX.md.

validation:
  - Local: npm ci && npm run validate (loads all lexicons).
  - CI must pass before proposing merge; update INDEX and examples with schema changes.

review_checklist:
  - NSID matches file name; defs include proper record/query/procedure shapes; required fields minimal and clear.
  - Examples validate; descriptions precise; refs correct; no unused defs.
  - GOVERNANCE and TERMINOLOGY references intact when adding normative requirements.

security_docs:
  - No secrets or environment credentials in repo; security disclosures via SECURITY.md only.

output_policy:
  - Propose minimal diffs with file/line context; batch trivial formatting; isolate breaking changes; include rationale referencing ADRs.
