feat: restructure repo for AI-native development

- Add AGENTS.md as universal AI entry point
- Create .ai/ directory with prompts, rules, and knowledge base
- Move SPECS_REQUIREMENTS.md to docs/requirements/
- Add memory-bank/ for active context tracking
- Update README with AI workflow documentation
- Add generic rules for cross-IDE support (Cursor, Claude, Windsurf, etc.)

This enables any AI coding assistant to autonomously draft, review, and
validate OpenAPI specs following our standards.
