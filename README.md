# RegistryAccord Protocol Specifications

An open protocol to enable creators to own their work, their audience, and the economics of their business.

### What is this Repository?

This repository is the canonical, language-neutral source of truth for the RegistryAccord protocol. It contains the technical specifications, data schemas (Lexicons), and architectural decisions that define how the network operates. All services and client tooling, regardless of the programming language they are written in, must adhere to the standards defined here.

-----

### Current Status

The RegistryAccord protocol is currently in **Phase 1: The Architect Phase**.

The specifications in this repository are in an early, formative stage. They are under active development and should be considered a `DRAFT` subject to change. We are building in the open and welcome feedback from the community.
